![Tests](https://github.com/ianflickinger/monet-maker/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

This is a support repository for a CycleGAN submission to the Kaggle competition "I'm Something of a Painter Myself". In this repository is a python library, a base kaggle kernel, and a reference of previous experiments to track design progress.


## Python library

The python package `monet_maker` is implemented in the `src` directory with unit tests in the `test` directory. The pyproject.toml and requirements.txt file are placed in the root directory to enable remote install using `pip`.
